# GitHub Repository Search

An app that searches for GitHub repositories.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and `cd` into it.
- Add a `.env` file to the project root.
- Add an `REACT_APP_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` entry to the `.env` file containing a valid GitHub OAuth token (check [this link](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) for intructions on how to create one).

```
REACT_APP_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_token_here>
```

- Run `yarn` to install the dependencies before the first run.
- Run `yarn start` to start the app and point your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`
